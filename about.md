I love making things, especially software. I write code to solve problems, yet I believe that often the best solution requires no code at all.
Creating things that people love brings me joy.

I love technology, particularly robots, computers, and artificial intelligence. My love for computers began with a Macintosh in the early '90s. While MacBooks are my favorite, I also enjoy working with Windows and Linux, especially Raspberry Pis.

I enjoy working out. I like the way it makes me look and feel.

Home ownership is another passion of mine. I strive for a home that is safe, functional, and a joy to live in. I care for quality things to make them last and enjoy lawns, vegetable gardens, backyard chickens, and trees. Home automation fascinates me—I love controlling my sprinklers and AC with an app.

Animals hold a special place in my heart. I have a dog and have raised chickens (with plans to get more soon). I enjoy zoos, aquariums, nature, and safaris. I’ve seen elephants, rhinos, and hippos in the wild and was once (harmlessly) bitten by a lion cub.

I grew up in Utah and have a deep love for the mountains. I enjoy snow skiing and water sports like boating, wakeboarding, and skiing. I’ve also lived in San Diego while working for the navy and absolutely love it there. I hope to buy a second home in San Diego someday.

I’m a huge fan of electronic vehicles. I had an ebike but fell off it and broke my collar bone. I still have a Segway that I LOVE to ride and am planning to get another ebike soon. My next goal is to get an electric car and, eventually, a single-passenger electric drone.

Movies are a bit challenging for me to sit through, but here are some of my favorites (in no particular order):

- The Matrix
- 3:10 to Yuma
- Gladiator
- Blood Diamond
- A Knight’s Tale
- The Lion King (1994 version)
- The Greatest Showman
- Saving Private Ryan
- MacGruber
- Schindler’s List
- The Green Mile
- Titanic
- 90s Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Waterboy)
- 90s Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber)

On the other hand, I LOVE YouTube. I enjoy long-form interviews with interesting people (like Lex Fridman), as well as murder mysteries, forensics, and detective work. Here are some of my favorites:

I deeply admire Elon Musk, the GOAT entrepreneur and internet troll. I look up to builders of all kinds who can take ideas and make them a reality.

I want to understand the world as much as possible. I want to make it a better place and enjoy my precious time while I'm here.
