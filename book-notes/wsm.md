# The Way of the Superior Man

> A man's value is no longer measured by what he does, by his finances, or his social standing. In our new world, a man's **presence** --his depth of awareness-- is his most valuable asset. - Preface XI

> Stop waiting. Feel everything. Love achingly. Give impeccably. Let go. - Preface XIV

> Don't believe in the myth of "one day when everything will be different." Do what you love to do, what you are waiting to do, what you've been born to do, now. - p1

> Closing down in the midst of pain is a denial of a man's true nature. A superior man is free in feeling and action, even amidst great pain and hurt. Only when the front of your body is relaxed and opened, your breath full and deep, and your gaze unguarded and directly connected with another person's eyes, can your fullest intelligence manifest spontaneously in the situation. - p2

> Live As If Your Father (or Mother) Were Dead. A man must love his father (mother) and yet be free of his father's (mother's) expectations and criticisms in order to be a free man. - p4

> Know and Live at your edge - p5
