# Thesis

## Foundation

### Total Market Funds ([SWTSX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swtsx) / [FSKAX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911693))
- Own the entire investable U.S. equity market
- Automatically captures future winners that cannot be predicted today
- Continuously rebalances as companies rise and fall
- Provides broad diversification and downside resilience
- Serves as the primary engine of long-term compounding

## Targeted Conviction Bets

### 1. Large-Cap Growth & AI Dominance Will Continue ([SWLGX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swlgx))
- Mega-cap tech platforms have durable competitive moats
- AI adoption disproportionately benefits firms with capital, data, and distribution

### 2. Small-Cap Value Will Mean Revert ([FISVX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T773))
- Historically among the highest long-term returning equity factors
- Currently out of favor after prolonged underperformance
- Provides diversification and low correlation to large-cap growth

### 3. Bitcoin will become a legitimate store of value ([FBTC](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/quote/dashboard/summary?symbol=FBTC))
- Small allocation provides asymmetric upside
- Only held in Roth accounts and capped at 5%

## Plan

### Maintain target allocations
- Contribute regularly to all accounts in the target allocations

### Rebalance annually
- Rebalance once per year (January). Do not rebalance intra-year
- Sell/Buy positions that have drifted +/- 5% beyond target

### Don’t touch it
- No new funds
- Do not add increase or reduce a position due to performance
- Do not respond to news, narratives, or short-term market cycles
- Do not optimize further, thinking more will reduce returns

### When changes are allowed
- Change in tax law or retirement account rules
- New account added
- Time horizons shortens significantly
- A fund changes (closed, merged, etc..)

### Long-Term expectations
- Expect multi-year periods where individual bets underperform
- Expect large drawdowns during market crises
- These outcomes are normal and required for long-term excess returns
- Success will come through discipline, not prediction

### Contribute often. Rebalance annually. Do nothing else. <br /> Chill 😎
