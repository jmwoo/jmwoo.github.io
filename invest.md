# Thesis

## Total Market Foundation ([SWTSX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swtsx) / [FSKAX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/315911693))

- Owns the entire investable U.S. equity market
- Automatically captures future winners that cannot be predicted today
- Continuously rebalances as companies rise and fall
- Provides broad diversification and downside resilience
- Serves as the primary engine of long-term compounding

## 3 Targeted Conviction Bets

### 1. Large-Cap Growth & AI Dominance Will Continue ([SWLGX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/swlgx))
- Mega-cap tech platforms have durable competitive moats
- AI adoption disproportionately benefits firms with capital, data, and distribution

### 2. Small-Cap Value Will Mean Revert ([FISVX](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31635T773))
- Historically among the highest long-term returning equity factors
- Currently out of favor after prolonged underperformance
- Provides diversification and low correlation to large-cap growth

### 3. Bitcoin will become a legitimate store of value ([FBTC](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/research/quote/dashboard/summary?symbol=FBTC))
- Small allocation provides asymmetric upside
