- Cut up bacon into ~1 inch pieces. 
- Add to a large pan and let cook until semi crispy. 
- While cooking, puncture potatoes with a fork and put in the microwave for 5 minutes or until soft. 
- drain bacon grease (as much as you want)
- Slice potatoes up and add them to bacon in the pan. 
- Cook until potatoes get golden and crispy (about ~5 more minutes). 
- In a separate pan, begin cooking tortillas until they are golden in some spots but still foldable (1 min each side for a hot pan).
- Scramble 4 eggs in a bowl and add to a vacant section of the pan. Once eggs are soft, mix the whole mixture together. 
- Add cheese. Once the cheese is melted the dish is ready to serve. 
- Add mixture to cooked tortilla and fold into a burrito. Enjoy!
